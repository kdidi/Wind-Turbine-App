# Wind-Turbine-App

******This app was a bonus feature for our wind turbine generator project and was created under an extremely tense timeline. The app in its entirety was coded in 3 days which could explain for certain areas where code seems inefficient or poorly structured.

Wind turbine app I made for my ELEC 391 project course. App connects to the microcontroller via bluetooth and displays the input voltage, output voltage, output current, duty cycle and power being generated by the wnd turbine. With the help of jjoe64's android graphing library, I was also able to plot the Output Power vs. Time. The app also allows for us to dynamically adjust the angle the wind turbine faces. Lastly, it can fetch real time weather data by making an API call to OpenWeatherMap and adjust the angle the turbine faces to align with the direction of wind.

******Please note that bluetooth functionaility was rather complex for my understanding and was taken from: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/814814/Android-Connectivity
